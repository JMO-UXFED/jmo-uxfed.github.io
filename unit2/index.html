	<h1>Web Design Challenge</h1>
	
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>I was inspired by the websites <a href="http://www.dnco.com" target="_blank">dnco</a><br>and <a href="http://www.workstead.com" target="_blank">Workstead</a>.</p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>dnco is a branding company. The website uses grayscale as its color scheme. The images are a direct representation of the brands its represents and are each a focal point, with the larger images having hierachy. Workstead is a design company. On its homepage there are the two options for admission to the website. Their pages effectively display what they do and their finished project effective use of space size and balance in great detail. The images fill the entire page showing their products and completed design work</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>Both websites use images as a hierachy on the page to sell their products/services</p>
