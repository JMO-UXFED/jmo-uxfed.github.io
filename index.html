	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I am an aspiring User Experience designer, living in New York City. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I believe that front end, web design and ux design all go hand in hand.  I want to expand my marketability because a lot of UX/UI posiitons want potential candidates to also know HTML and CSS.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a UX Designer/Front End Developer with JetBlue Airlines because I like to work in a creative environment.  I also like a lot of flexibility and would cherish the opportunity to work in a non traditional setting.</p>
